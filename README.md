# restaurant-page

This is a sample restaurant page made for the Odin Project. 

Aims of the project: Use webpack in order to make a fully functional site, using modules and javascript to manipulate the DOM and dynamically render a simple restaurant homepage.


The webpage will have 3 main pages which will need to be populated by modules which manipulate the DOM and enable tabbed browsing without requiring the page to reload.

The webpage is a mock of a fake restaurant, a salami-only themed restaurant called 'La Salamaia', which features salami appetisers, mains, and desserts.
