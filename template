                This is absolutely the best restaurant I have ever been to. 
                At first thought, I thought salami couldn't exclusively bring
                me the same joy as a bowl of sushi could, but 1 mouthful of each of the courses
                just brought me extreme joy and satisfaction. The head chef really does know what he's
                doing! <br> - Remi
